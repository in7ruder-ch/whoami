    <h1>How I Bypassed a Corporate Firewall</h1>
    <p><em>Published June 2025</em></p>

    <p>During a recent internal network engagement, the client's firewall was configured with restrictive outbound
      rules, but as always — where there’s an egress, there’s a way.</p>

    <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
    <p>After landing a shell on an internal system via a phishing payload, I quickly realized most outbound ports were
      blocked — even 443. DNS was still open, though.</p>

    <h2>DNS Tunneling</h2>
    <p>I deployed a <strong>dnscat2</strong> server on my VPS and connected via a PowerShell payload. While throughput
      was limited, I had enough bandwidth to exfil credentials and later upload a stager.</p>

    <h2>Payloads Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial loader via macro + mshta</li>
      <li>Stage 1 DNS reverse shell (dnscat2)</li>
      <li>Stage 2 PowerShell Empire stager</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Organizations often overlook outbound traffic restrictions — especially DNS. I recommended egress filtering,
      application whitelisting, and DNS logging via SIEM as remediation.</p>

    <p>This was a great example of why layered security matters. Firewalls aren’t magic — they’re just part of the
      story.</p>
